  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Nick Scoles and I am a senior at Lewis University. 
  I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science via the 3 + 1 program with COD and Lewis.
  I hope to go into the computer programming industry once I graduate. 
  I am from a family of five and I am the eldest of my three siblings. 
  A fun fact about me is that I'm the tallest out of the five of us.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>How to more effectively implement SCRUM</li>
    <li>Expand my knowledge of coding with various languages</li>
    <li>Gain a better understanding of the importance of teamwork</li>
   
  </ul>
